            GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
            WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
            THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
            WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
            THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
            WHEN I click on the GitHub username
            THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
            WHEN I start the application
            THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
            WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
            THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
            WHEN I select the engineer option
            THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
            WHEN I select the intern option
            THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
